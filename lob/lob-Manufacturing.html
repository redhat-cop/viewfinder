<p>The manufacturing industry is increasingly reliant on digital systems, automation, and interconnected technologies, making it a growing target for cyberattacks. Cyber threats in this sector can not only disrupt production lines but also compromise sensitive intellectual property, supply chain operations, and crit ical safety systems. A robust IT security framework is essential to protect business continuity and maintain operational integrity.

        <div class="niceList-advice">
        <ul>
            <li>Manufacturing environments typically involve both Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (O T) systems, such as industrial control systems (ICS) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. It is essential to segment these networks to limit t he potential spread of malware or cyberattacks between business systems and production systems. Implement firewalls, virtual LANs (VLANs), and access control lists (AC Ls) to strictly manage how data flows between IT and OT environments.</li>

        <div class="niceList-advice">
        <ul>
            <li>Manufacturi ng systems often include a mix of legacy equipment and modern devices, making them vulnerable to cyberattacks. All endpoints, including workstations, industrial device s, and IoT sensors, should be protected by antivirus software, endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions, and regular security patches. Additionally, intrusion d etection systems (IDS) and security information and event management (SIEM) solutions can help monitor networks for unusual behavior and potential intrusions.</li>

        <div class="niceList-advice">
        <ul>
            <li>Manufacturing companies often manage sensitive intellectual property, such as p roduct designs and proprietary processes. This data should be classified and protected through encryption, role-based access controls (RBAC), and data loss prevention (DLP) tools. Secure data backups should be maintained both on-premises and in offsite locations to ensure recovery in the event of ransomware attacks or system failures.</li>

    <div class="box d"><h4 class="title-text-small">Supply Chain Security</h4>
        <div class="niceList-advice">
        <ul>
            <li>Third-party suppliers and contractors often have access to manufacturing systems and sensitive da ta, making supply chains a common attack vector. Organisations should conduct thorough risk assessments of vendors, implement third-party security policies, and requir e cybersecurity compliance certifications before granting access. Secure remote access solutions, such as VPNs with multi-factor authentication (MFA), can further redu ce supply chain risks.</li>

        <div class="niceList-advice">
        <ul>
            <li>Employees on the production floor, in administrative offices, and a cross supply chains must be trained on cybersecurity best practices. Regular training sessions should cover phishing awareness, password management, and incident repor ting procedures. Additionally, providing specialised training for engineers and technicians on the security of industrial control systems can help mitigate risks unique to OT environments.</li>

        <div class="niceList-advice">
        <ul>
            <li>Manufacturing organisations should develop incident respon se plans that outline procedures for identifying, containing, and recovering from cyberattacks. Business continuity plans should prioritise restoring critical systems such as production lines and supply chain logistics. Regular drills and tabletop exercises can help assess preparedness and identify gaps in the response process.</li>
