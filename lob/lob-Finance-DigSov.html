                    <p class="sovereign-text">Organizations must rigorously <b>classify and localize</b> all client data and <b>regulatory reporting data</b> according to local financial stability laws (e.g., DORA, CCPA). Implement FIPS 140-2 validated <b>encryption and strong access controls</b>, ensuring the financial institution, not the service provider, maintains sole control over the <b>cryptographic keys</b>. Contracts must include clauses guaranteeing prompt access for <b>regulatory audits</b> and defined <b>data repatriation</b> pathways.</p>

Pursue a <b>multi-cloud or hybrid strategy</b> based on <b>vendor-agnostic technologies</b> to ensure the <b>portability of critical workloads</b> (e.g., trading engines, ledgers).
