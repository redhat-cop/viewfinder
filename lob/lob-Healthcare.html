<p>Healthcare organisations handle highly sensitive patient data, making them prime targets for cyberattacks. The consequences of a breach can be seve re, affecting patient privacy, safety, and operational continuity. Robust IT security measures are essential to protect patient information, ensure regulatory complian ce, and maintain trust in healthcare services.<br></p>

    <div class="box a"><h4 class="title-text-small">Data Protection and Encryption</h4>
        <div class="niceList-advice">
        <ul>
            <li>Healthcare organisations must prioritise data protection by encrypting patient data both at rest and in transit using strong encryption protocols like AES-256. Electronic Health Records (EHRs), financial information, and medical imaging data should be classified based on sensitivity, with strict access controls applied to the most sensitive information. Regular data backups should be conducted and stored securely offsite to mitigate the risk of ransomware attacks.</li>

        <div class="niceList-advice">
        <ul>
            <li>Implementing role-based access control (RBAC) ensures that staff only access the data necessary for their job roles. Strong identity and access management (IAM) systems, combined with multi-factor authentication (MFA), help prevent unautho rised access. Privileged accounts should be closely monitored, with regular reviews of user permissions to prevent privilege creep.</li>

        <div class="niceList-advice">
        <ul>
            <li>Medical devices, administrative systems, and patient data servers should be isolated through network segmentation to limit the impact of potential breache s. Secure Wi-Fi networks and firewalls should be used to prevent unauthorised access. All endpoints, including laptops, tablets, and medical IoT devices, must be prote cted with antivirus software, endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions, and regular security patches.</li>

    <div class="box d"><h4 class="title-text-small">Compliance with Regulatory Standards</h4>
        <div class="niceList-advice">
        <ul>
            <li>Healthcare organ isations are subject to strict regulatory frameworks such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) , and Network and Information Systems (NIS) Directive. Regular compliance audits and risk assessments ensure that security practices align with these regulations. Orga nisations should maintain clear data protection policies and document their compliance efforts.</li>

        <div class="niceList-advice">
        <ul>
            <li>A well-defined in cident response plan is essential to minimise the impact of cyberattacks on patient care. The plan should outline how to identify, contain, and recover from security b reaches while maintaining critical services. Regular tabletop exercises and disaster recovery drills will help ensure staff are prepared to respond effectively to cyber incidents.</li>

        <div class="niceList-advice">
        <ul>
            <li>Connected medical devices, such as patient monitors and infusion pumps, pose unique cybersecurity risks. Devices should b e regularly updated with the latest security patches and configured to use secure communication protocols. Access to medical IoT devices should be tightly controlled, and manufacturers should be required to adhere to cybersecurity best practices.</li>
