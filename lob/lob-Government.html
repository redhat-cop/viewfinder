<p>Government organisations are prime targets for cyberattacks due to the sensitive nature of the data they handle, including citizen information, cla ssified documents, and critical infrastructure systems. Protecting this information is essential to maintaining public trust, national security, and the continuity of government services. A comprehensive, proactive approach to IT security is vital to mitigating risks and ensuring resilience.<br></p>

        <div class="niceList-advice">
        <ul>
            <li>Government organisations should adopt a Zero Trust security model, which assumes that no entity—internal or external—should be auto matically trusted. This approach requires continuous verification of all users, devices, and applications attempting to access systems or data. Key components include strong identity and access management (IAM), multi-factor authentication (MFA), and least privilege access, ensuring users only have access to the systems they need for their roles.</li>

        <div class="niceList-advice">
        <ul>
            <li>Classifying data based on its sensitivity helps prioritise security measu res. Highly sensitive information, such as citizen data or classified government records, should be encrypted both at rest and in transit using industry-standard encry ption protocols like AES-256. Access to such data should be strictly controlled and monitored, with logs regularly reviewed to detect unauthorised access.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Routine vulnerability assessments and automated patch management are essential to protect systems a gainst known exploits. Outdated software remains one of the most common attack vectors, making it crucial to keep all operating systems, applications, and firmware up to date. Establishing baseline security configurations for devices and servers also helps reduce unnecessary risk.</li>

        <div class="niceList-advice">
        <ul>
            <li>Employees often represent the weakest link in cybersecurity. Regular cybersecurity awareness training is essential to help sta ff recognise phishing attempts, social engineering tactics, and proper data handling procedures. Insider threats—whether intentional or accidental—should be mitigated through monitoring user behavior, applying least privilege access policies and conducting background checks on personnel with access to sensitive information.

        <ul>
            <li>A clear incident response plan is vital for minimizing the impact of security breaches. Th is plan should outline roles, responsibilities, and escalation procedures, along with communication strategies for both internal and external stakeholders. Business co ntinuity and disaster recovery plans should be regularly tested to ensure critical systems can be restored quickly in the event of an attack.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Government organisations must comply with national and international cybersecurity regulat ions, such as the NIS2 Directive, or GDPR where applicable. Collaboration with cybersecurity agencies, such as national CERTs or intelligence-sharing networks, can hel p organisations stay updated on emerging threats and leverage collective expertise to improve security postures.</li>
