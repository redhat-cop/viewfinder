    <div class="box a"><h4 class="title-text-small">Implement a Layered Security Approach</h4>
        <div class="niceList-advice">
        <ul>
            <li>A layered, or defense-in-depth, approach is critical for financial organisations. This involves deploying multiple security controls across different layers of the IT environment, including firewalls, intrusion detection sy stems, endpoint protection, and data encryption. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be mandatory for accessing sensitive systems, while network segmentation can help isolate critical infrastructure from less secure environments.</li>
            </ul>

    <div class="box b"><h4 class="title-text-small">Data Protection and Encryption</h4>
        <div class="niceList-advice">
        <ul>
            <li>Sensitive financial data, such as customer records and payment information, must be encrypted both at rest and in transit. Organisations should adopt strong encryption standards (such as AES-256) and ensure enc ryption keys are securely managed. Regular data backups, stored in secure offsite locations, can help mitigate the impact of ransomware attacks and data breaches.</li>

    <div class="box c"><h4 class="title-text-small">Regular Security Assessments and Patch Management</h4>
        <div class="niceList-advice">
        <ul>
            <li>Routine vulnerability assessments and penetration testing can identify weaknesses in systems bef ore attackers do. Financial institutions must establish strict patch management policies to ensure that software, operating systems, and applications are updated with the latest security patches. Automating patch deployment can help reduce human error and ensure timely updates.</li>

        <div class="niceList-advice">
        <ul>
            <li>Human error remains one of the most common causes of data breaches. Comprehensive cybersecurity training programs should be implemented to educate staff on best prac tices, phishing attack recognition, and social engineering tactics. Simulated phishing campaigns can help reinforce awareness and improve employee response to threats.</li>

        <div class="niceList-advice">
        <ul>
            <li>A clear incident response plan is vital for minimizing the impact of security breaches. Th is plan should outline roles, responsibilities, and escalation procedures, along with communication strategies for both internal and external stakeholders. Business co ntinuity and disaster recovery plans should be regularly tested to ensure critical systems can be restored quickly in the event of an attack.</li>
